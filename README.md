# Instructions for use

## Which file to run
Run the app.py file. The rest are just for testing, and are not important; they will be deleted before final submission

## Known bugs
Make sure that the entire person is visible in all parts of the video. This means that it the video will have to be edited to cut out the part where the user starts and backs up, and also the part where the user finishes and approaches the camera to end. The video should essentially start and end with the whole person visible, otherwise it will crash.

Full bug testing has not yet been done, however for the most part during testing the videos have been analysed fairly successfully
